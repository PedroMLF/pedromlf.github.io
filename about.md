Hi! My name is Pedro Ferreira and I work as a Data Scientist (Junior) at [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/pt/), since November '18. Before, I spent around one year at [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/), as Undergraduate Research Intern, working on my Master Thesis (entitled _Improving the Quality of Neural Machine Translation_), with professor [Andr√© Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/).

I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and more precisely in using machine learning techniques to make everyday tasks as efficient as possible. I enjoy programming and thinking about projects as a whole, from gathering insights from data, to deploying robust and reliable solutions. In particular, I try to be versatile and able to work with different types of data, in different scenarios.

I use this blog to share some of the cool things I discover along the way :)
