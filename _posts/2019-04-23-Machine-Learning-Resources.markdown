During college I had the chance of creating a group about machine learning with a couple of friends. Together, we were responsible for preparing workshops, organizing events with invited lecturers, etc. One of the cool things that also came out of that project was a [**list of resources**](https://github.com/MachineLearningAcademy/Resources).

With this list we tried to:
- _Cover the fundamentals_, by linking to several introductory articles/book chapters.
- _Provide different sources_, from online courses, to books, in-depth articles, blog posts and tutorials.
- _Cover task specific resources_, mainly for NLP and Computer Vision.
- _Be minimal_, and stick only to the best resources.

You can also find this list in our [Resources](/resources/) tab. Enjoy!
